# Creating your first robot

It is time to create your own first robot.

Initially this is shown in built-in code editor. 
On the next page, we will set it up to work with IntelliJ IDEA instead. 
It is much easier to develop your robot this way, because you get all your usual help from IntelliJ.

## Robot types

There are three types of robots, we can pick from. It is essentially about how advanced they are, what we can make the do. They are

* [Junior Robot](https://robocode.sourceforge.io/docs/robocode/robocode/JuniorRobot.html)
* [Robot](https://robocode.sourceforge.io/docs/robocode/robocode/Robot.html)
* [Advanced Robot](https://robocode.sourceforge.io/docs/robocode/robocode/AdvancedRobot.html)

I strongly recommend just sticking to the Junior Robot, and will only explain this one.

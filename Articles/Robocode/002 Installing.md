# Installing Robocode

I recommend downloading the jar file from Itslearning. It is just faster. It is version 1.9.5.5.

Alternatively, you can download the latest version of Robocode from the official website: [Robocode Download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/robocode/files/robocode/).

It took about 30 minutes for me.

## Installation.

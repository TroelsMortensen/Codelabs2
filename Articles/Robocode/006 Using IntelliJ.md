# Setting up IntelliJ for RoboCode

Instead of the built-in editor, we can use IntelliJ IDEA. This is obviously just a much better code editor, and therefore the development of your robot is easier.

In the following video, I will show you how to set up IntelliJ IDEA for Robocode development:

Coming up, I will give a brief overview of the JuniorRobot API, i.e. what we can make it do, and how.

## Note:

Reinstalling Robocode recently, I no longer had access to Java 19. 21 did not work for me, but 17 did.

The problem only occurred when trying to import the Robot into the Robocode program.

In class, I (your teacher) will just collect all robots from students into my own project. 

This way, if you use a later Java version, you may still be able to develop your robot, but maybe not test it in Robocode.

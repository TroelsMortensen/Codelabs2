# Expressions and Boolean Expressions in Java


An expression in Java is a combination of values, variables, operators, and method calls that _produces a single value_. Expressions can be as simple as a single value or variable, or more complex, involving multiple operations.

**Examples of expressions:**
```java
5 + 3           // produces 8
x * 2           // if x = 4, produces 8
"Hello" + "!"   // produces "Hello!"
```

## What is a Boolean Expression?

A boolean expression is an expression that evaluates to either `true` or `false`. Boolean expressions are often used in decision-making statements like `if`, `while`, and `for` loops.

**Examples of boolean expressions:**
```java
5 > 3                   // true
x == 10                 // true if x is 10, false otherwise
isRaining && isCold     // true if both variables are true
!(a < b)                // true if a is not less than b
```

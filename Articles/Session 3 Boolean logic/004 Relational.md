# Relational Operators

Relational operators are used to compare two values. They return a boolean value (`true` or `false`) based on the comparison.

## Relational Operators Table

| Expression                        | Operator |
|-----------------------------------|----------|
| Is x greater than y?              | x > y    |
| Is x less than y?                 | x < y    |
| Is x greater than or equal to y?  | x >= y   |
| Is x less than or equal to y?     | x <= y   |

Example:

```java
int x = 5;
int y = 10;

System.out.println(x > y);   // false
System.out.println(x < y);   // true
System.out.println(x >= y);  // false
System.out.println(x <= y);  // true
```

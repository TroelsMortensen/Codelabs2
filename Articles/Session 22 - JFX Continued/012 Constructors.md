# Init() and constructor

Sometimes, you have a view, which needs to be initialized with some data. In your semester project, maybe that is a `DataManager`.\
I have two approaches for this:
- an init() method, which you manually call after creating the view
- a constructor, requiring a little setup with a factory

I have no strong preference, but I show both approaches in the videos below.

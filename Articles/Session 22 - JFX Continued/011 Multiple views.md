# How to handle multiple views

In many applications, you will need to show different views to the user. For example, you may have a login screen, and after successful login, you may want to show a different screen. Or you may want to show a different screen, depending on the user's role. Then the user can browse between the different views, and the application will show the appropriate view for the user.

We need to manage this in a somewhat consistent way.

The below video introduces the concept of a "View Manager", which is responsible for switching between the different views.

# Introduction to Interfaces

## Building on Abstract Classes

In the previous session (Session 14 - Abstract), you learned about abstract classes and methods. You discovered how abstract classes can define common behavior while forcing subclasses to implement specific methods. Abstract classes are powerful, but they have limitations - a class can only extend one other class.

Now it's time to explore **interfaces** - the next step in Java's object-oriented programming toolkit. Interfaces take the concept of abstract classes one step further by allowing a class to implement multiple interfaces, providing even more flexibility in your designs.

## What You'll Learn

This session will cover:

1. **What are Interfaces** - Understanding the concept and purpose of interfaces
2. **Interface vs Abstract Class** - When to use each approach
3. **Defining Interfaces** - How to create and declare interfaces
4. **Implementing Interfaces** - How classes implement interface contracts
5. **Multiple Interfaces** - How a class can implement multiple interfaces
6. **Interface Inheritance** - How interfaces can extend other interfaces
7. **Polymorphism with Interfaces** - Using interfaces for flexible programming
8. **Common Interface Patterns** - Real-world examples and best practices

## What are Interfaces?

An **interface** in Java is a reference type that defines a contract for classes to follow. It's like a blueprint that specifies what methods a class must implement, but it doesn't provide any implementation itself.

Think of an interface as a **contract** or **agreement**:
- It defines what a class **must be able to do**
- It doesn't specify **how** the class should do it
- Any class that implements the interface **promises** to provide those capabilities

## Real-World Analogy

Think of an interface like a **job description**:

- **Job Description** (Interface): "Must be able to drive, communicate with customers, and handle money"
- **Employee** (Class): Each employee implements these requirements differently
- **Taxi Driver**: Drives a car, talks to passengers, handles cash payments
- **Delivery Person**: Drives a van, talks to customers, handles credit card payments
- **Bus Driver**: Drives a bus, makes announcements, handles fare collection

All employees fulfill the same job requirements, but they do it in their own unique way.

## Why Interfaces Matter

Interfaces are powerful because they:

- **Define contracts** - Specify what classes must be able to do
- **Enable multiple inheritance** - A class can implement multiple interfaces
- **Promote loose coupling** - Code depends on interfaces, not concrete classes
- **Enable polymorphism** - Different implementations can be treated uniformly
- **Improve testability** - Easy to create mock implementations for testing

## The Next Step Beyond Abstract Classes

Interfaces are the natural evolution of abstract classes:

- **Abstract Classes**: "Here's some common code, but you must implement these specific methods"
- **Interfaces**: "Here's what you must be able to do, but you choose how to implement it"

Interfaces take the concept of abstract classes one step further by:
- **Removing implementation** - No concrete methods or fields
- **Allowing multiple inheritance** - A class can implement many interfaces
- **Focusing purely on contracts** - What a class must be able to do

## What's Next

In the following articles, we'll explore each of these concepts in detail, starting with understanding what interfaces are and how they differ from abstract classes, then diving into practical examples and real-world applications.

Get ready to take your object-oriented programming skills to the next level with interfaces!

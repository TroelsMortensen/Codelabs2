# Exercise: Console Racing Game

![racer](Resources/Racers.png)


## Task

Create a console-based racing game where the player competes against AI opponents. The game uses a dice-rolling mechanic where players guess numbers, and different NPC racers use different strategies to make their guesses.

You will need:
* An interface `NpcRacer` that defines how AI racers make guesses
* Different implementations of `NpcRacer` with unique strategies
* A `RacingGame` class that manages the game state and console UI
* A main class to run the game


The following is a class diagram of the game. You may rework it as you see fit, this is just for inspiration. Maybe you wish to add more interfaces, or more classes.


```mermaid
classDiagram
    class NpcRacer {
        <<interface>>
        _+ makeGuess() int_
        _+ getName() String_
        _+ updatePosition(newPosition : int) void_
    }
    
    class RandomRacer {
        - name : String
        - random : Random
        - position : int
    }
    
    class ConservativeRacer {
        - name : String
        - random : Random
        - position : int
    }
    
    class RiskyRacer {
        - name : String
        - random : Random
        - position : int
    }

    class Player {
        - name : String
        - position : int
        + makeGuess() int
        + getName() String
        + updatePosition(newPosition : int) void
    }

    class RacingGame {
        - racers : ArrayList~NpcRacer~
        - player : Player
        - trackLength : int
        + addRacer(racer : NpcRacer) void
        + startGame() void
        + showMenu() void
        + playRound() void
        + showPositions() void
        + checkWinner() void
    }

    class RunGame {
        + main(args : String[]) void
    }

    
    NpcRacer <|.. RandomRacer
    NpcRacer <|.. ConservativeRacer
    NpcRacer <|.. RiskyRacer
    RacingGame --> "*" NpcRacer
    RacingGame --> Player
    RunGame ..> RacingGame
```	

Now you're probably thinking, maybe it would be smarter to make `NpcRacer` an abstract class, and have the different strategies be subclasses. That would be a good idea, but in this learning path, we practice interfaces. You _could_ introduce an abstract class, which implements the `NpcRacer` interface.

## The Game

* The program should request the player's name.
* The program should ask the user to add NPC racers, with their names.
* The program should ask the user how long the track is (somewhere between 25 is probably a good default, you may add constraints for min and max length)
* The user can then start the game, which will run a number of rounds, with the following steps:
    * Generate two random numbers between 0 and 5
    * Add them together to get the target sum (this will make uneven likelyhoods, so some numbers are more likely to be the target sum than others)
    * Ask the player to guess the target sum
    * Ask the NPC racers to guess the target sum (each should generate a number based on their strategy)
    * Based on the guesses, each racer gets its position updated
    * Check if the player or any of the NPC racers have won
* Any racer that guesses correctly, moves forward based on the probability of that sum:
    * 0 or 10: 4 spaces
    * 1-2 or 8-9: 3 spaces
    * 3-4 or 6-7: 2 spaces
    * 5: 1 space

## UI

The UI should be console-based. You can create a numbered menu, and then for displaying the game's race track, you can use a simple ASCII art. Something like this:

```
Player:  ----------------------------| Goal
Racer 1: ----------------------------|
Racer 2: ----------------------------|
Racer 3: ----------------------------|
Racer 4: ----------------------------|
Racer 5: ----------------------------|
```

Then place an X at the position of each racer, to show where they are:

```
Player:  ---------------------X------| Goal
Racer 1: -------------X--------------|
Racer 2: ------X---------------------|
Racer 3: ----------------X-----------|
Racer 4: ----------X-----------------|
Racer 5: -------------------X--------|
```

Or you can come up with your own ASCII art. IntelliJ can also print various symbols, like ðŸš— for a car. Or you can use emojis.


## Interface Design

Create an `NpcRacer` interface with these methods:

```java
public interface NpcRacer {
    int makeGuess();
    String getName();
}
```
## NPC racers

Create different implementations of the `NpcRacer` interface. Each NpcRacer should have a unique strategy for making guesses.\
Strategies can include:
- Random guessing, just pick a random number between 0 and 10
- Conservative guessing, pick a number between 3 and 7, as the likelyhood of these numbers are higher
- Risky guessing, pick a number less than 3 or greater than 7
- Lucky guessing, pick a number between 0 and 10, but vary the likelyhood of each number




## Main Class

```java
public class RacingGameDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        RacingGame game = new RacingGame();
        game.startGame();
    }
}
```

    class RacingGameDemo {
        + main(args : String[]) void
    }
    
    NpcRacer <|.. RandomRacer
    NpcRacer <|.. ConservativeRacer
    NpcRacer <|.. RiskyRacer
    NpcRacer <|.. SmartRacer

```

## Key Learning Points

### 1. **Interface Polymorphism**
- All NPC racers implement the same `NpcRacer` interface
- The `RacingGame` can work with any racer type without knowing the specific implementation
- Demonstrates how interfaces enable polymorphic behavior

### 2. **Strategy Pattern**
- Different racers use different strategies for making guesses
- Each strategy is encapsulated in its own class
- Easy to add new racer types without modifying existing code

### 3. **Adaptive Behavior**
- `SmartRacer` learns from previous results and adapts its strategy
- `LuckyRacer` gets better over time, simulating "hot streaks"
- Shows how interfaces can support complex, stateful behaviors

### 4. **Console UI Design**
- Visual representation of the race track
- Interactive menu system for game control
- Real-time feedback on game state

### 5. **Game Mechanics**
- Probability-based movement system
- Different strategies have different success rates
- Engaging gameplay that teaches interface concepts

## Extension Ideas

1. **Add more racer types:**
   - `CheaterRacer` - sometimes gets extra moves
   - `CopycatRacer` - copies the player's last guess
   - `PatternRacer` - looks for patterns in dice results

2. **Enhance the game:**
   - Add power-ups and special moves
   - Implement different track types
   - Add betting system

3. **Improve the UI:**
   - Add colors to the console output
   - Create ASCII art for the cars
   - Add sound effects (if possible)

This exercise demonstrates the power of interfaces in creating flexible, engaging systems while being fun to play and educational!

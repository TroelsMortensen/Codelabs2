# Variables

Every program works with data, and in Java, we use variables to store and manipulate this data. 

You may be familiar with a similar concept from mathematics, where a variable can represent a number or an unknown value. In programming, variables can hold different types of data, such as numbers, text, or even more complex objects.

> x = 5

In this example, `x` is a variable that holds the value `5`. You can think of it as a box labeled `x` that contains the number `5`.

In Java, we can declare variables, but we must also define its type. The type of a variable determines what kind of data it can hold.\
For example, if you want to store a whole number, you would use the `int` type, and if you want to store a decimal number, you would use the `double` type.\
If you want to store some text, you would use the `String` type.

Here is how you can declare a variable in Java:

```java
int x = 5; 
double y = 3.14; 
String name = "Alice"; 
```

In this example:
- `int x = 5;` declares a variable `x` of type `int` and assigns it the value `5`.
- `double y = 3.14;` declares a variable `y` of type `double` and assigns it the value `3.14`.
- `String name = "Alice";` declares a variable `name` of type `String` and assigns it the value `"Alice"`.

We use the `=` operator to assign a value to a variable. This is called an **assignment**. The variable type and name comes before the `=` sign, and the value comes after it.

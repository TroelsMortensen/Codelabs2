# Data types

Java has two kinds of data types:

1. **Primitive data types**: These are the basic data types that are built into the Java language. They include
    * `int` (integer)
    * `double` (floating-point number)
    * `char` (character)
    * `boolean` (true/false)
    * `byte` (8-bit integer)
    * `short` (16-bit integer)
    * `long` (64-bit integer)
    * `float` (single-precision floating-point number)

2. **Reference data types**: These are data types that refer to objects. They include:
   * Classes
   * Interfaces
   * Arrays

We will focus on primitive data types for now, and come back to the reference data types later in the course.

The following pages will introduce each type in detail, but for now, here is a brief overview of the primitive data types:

| Data Type | Size (bits) | Description                          |
|-----------|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| `int`     | 32          | Integer value, e.g., 42              |
| `double`  | 64          | Floating-point number, e.g., 3.14    |
| `char`    | 16          | Single character, e.g., 'A'          |
| `boolean` | 1           | True or false value                  |
| `byte`    | 8           | Small integer value, e.g., 100       |
| `short`   | 16          | Small integer value, e.g., 1000      |
| `long`    | 64          | Large integer value, e.g., 100000L   |  
| `float`   | 32          | Single-precision floating-point, e.g., 3.14f |

# Boolean type

Your program often needs to make decisions based on conditions.\
If the value of a variable is above a certain threshold, you might want to take one action, and if it is below that threshold, you might want to take another action.

* Is the variable `x` greater than `10`? -> yes or no.
* Is the text "Hello" equal to "World"? -> yes or no.
* Is 'F' a vowel? -> yes or no.

Maybe you have once done some online shopping, and when checking out, you forgot to input your email. The website might have shown you a message like "Please enter your email address."\
This is a decision that the program made based on the condition that your email address was not provided.

The above examples are all questions that can be answered with either "yes" or "no."\

In programming, we instead declare statements. A statement is a sentence that can be either true or false.\
For example:

* The variable `x` is greater than `10`. -> true or false.
* The text "Hello" is equal to "World". -> true or false.
* The character 'F' is a vowel. -> true or false.
* The number `5` is even. -> true or false.
* The number `3` is greater than `10`. -> true or false.
* The text "Java" contains the letter 'a'. -> true or false.

All these statements can be evaluated to either true or false.\

In Java, we use the `boolean` type to represent these true or false values.\
A `boolean` variable can hold one of two values: `true` or `false`. Here are some examples of declaring and using `boolean` variables:

```java
boolean thisIsTrue = true; // This variable is true
boolean thisIsFalse = false; // This variable is false
```

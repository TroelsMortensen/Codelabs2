# Classes

A class is also something we will elaborate on later.

For now, each exercise will be a new class (or java file), with a `main` method inside it.

Watch here how a new class is created in IntelliJ IDEA:

And the end result looks like this:

Notice a new file is created in the session1 package.

Packages are similar to folders, they are a way to organize your code.

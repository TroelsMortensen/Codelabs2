# Introduction to RoboCode

RoboCode is a programming game where you control a robot in a battle arena. The goal is to write a robot that can outsmart and outmaneuver other robots. The game is designed to help you learn programming concepts, algorithms, and strategies in a fun and engaging way.

You are going to write Java code, and the robots will be compiled and run in a simulated environment. The robots will battle against each other, and the one that survives the longest wins the match.

RoboCode provides a simple API that allows you to control the robot's movement, firing, and scanning capabilities. 

You can also customize the robot's behavior by implementing different strategies and algorithms. The game is highly customizable, allowing you to create your own robots, arenas, and battle rules.

There is a wiki available at [RoboCode Wiki](https://robowiki.net/wiki/Main_Page) that contains a lot of information about the game, including tutorials, API documentation, and community resources.

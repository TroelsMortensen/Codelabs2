# Installing RoboCode

I strongly recommend downloading the jar file from itslearning. It is just faster. It is version 1.9.5.5.

Alternatively, you can download the latest version of RoboCode from the official website: [RoboCode Download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/robocode/files/robocode/).

It took about 30 minutes for me.

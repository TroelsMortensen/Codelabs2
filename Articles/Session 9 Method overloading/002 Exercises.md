# Method Overloading Exercises

## Exercise 1 - Calculator Class

Create a Calculator class with overloaded methods for basic arithmetic operations. Implement multiple versions of add, subtract, multiply, and divide methods to handle different parameter types and counts.

**Requirements:**
- Overloaded `add` methods: two integers, two doubles, three integers, array of integers
- Overloaded `subtract` methods: two integers, two doubles
- Overloaded `multiply` methods: two integers, two doubles, integer and double
- Overloaded `divide` methods: two integers (return double), two doubles, integer by double
- Static methods for each operation
- Handle division by zero with appropriate messages

Then test your methods from a main method, print out relevant messages.

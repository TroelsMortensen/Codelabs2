# Introduction

Not much. But if I don't have an introduction page, you will just be confused.

I include several exercises here, to help you prepare for the exam.

You will notice they are intentionally a bit "slim", which is because at the exam, you will be asked to add more code to the exercises. For example:

- overload constructors
- getters and setters
- toString() method
- equals() method
- other methods
- other fields
- implement a relationship (association, aggregation, composition)

You may have to add more than what the diagram shows, for you code to work.

# Introduction

You have already seen how we store text data in variables of type `String`.

```java
String greeting = "Hello, World!";
```

You have also seen that we can check if two strings are equal using the `equals` method:

```java
String first = "Hello";
String second = "Hello";
boolean areEqual = first.equals(second);
System.out.println(areEqual); // true
```

But, because the String is an object, there are many more methods available to us.\
Remember, methods are operations that belong to a class, and the `String` class is no exception.\
In this article, we will look at some of the most commonly used methods of the `String` class:

* length
* toUpperCase
* toLowerCase
* contains
* startsWith
* endsWith
* charAt
* substring
* indexOf
* replace
* trim

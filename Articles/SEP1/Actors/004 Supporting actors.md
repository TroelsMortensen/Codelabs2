# Supporting actors

These are actors, which support the functionality of the system. They do not interact with the system, instead, the system interacts with them. 

Notice the difference, who is the one doing an action. When a human interacts with a system, they actively click a button, for example.

When a system interacts with a supporting system, usually this is in a form of some request over the network.

We have something active, doing the action, and something passive, waiting for an action.

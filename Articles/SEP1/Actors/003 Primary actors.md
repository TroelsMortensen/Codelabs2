# Primary actors

We can categorize actors into several groups. 

Primary actors are the actors which are the main focus of the system. These are the actors, which interact with the system. They _make the system do something_.

Often, these actors are human users. But, it could also be other applications, which interact with our system.

We rarely see these non-human actors in our semester projects

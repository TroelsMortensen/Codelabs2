# Use Case Description Exercises

For each exercise, write a complete use case description using either the section-based format or the table format. Include all relevant elements: summary, user stories (if applicable, or make something up), define the primary actor, list the preconditions, list the post conditions, list the includes (if applicable), describe the main scenario, describe the alternative scenarios, and list the notes.

Some descriptions are perhaps a bit vague or abstract. Whenever you are in doubt, just make a decision, and explain why you made that decision.

The purpose is to think about how the user achieves their goal. Be thorough with the main sequence of steps. Do put some effort into the alternative scenarios, considering branches, or potential errors in the process.

## Exercise 1: Food Truck Menu Update

The food truck owner starts their day by checking their current inventory through the system.\
Based on what ingredients are available, they can quickly update today's menu offerings.\
The system helps them see which signature dishes can be made with current stock and suggests alternatives for items that are missing key ingredients.\
Once the menu is finalized, it can be published to the food truck's online presence where customers can see what's available today.

## Exercise 2: Board Game Café Reservation

A customer visits the board game café's website.\
They select their preferred date and time, and specify how many people will be in their group.\
The system shows available tables that can accommodate their party size during that time slot.\
Once a table is reserved, the customer can browse the café's game library, filtered by the number of players in their group and game duration.\
They can add games to a "wishlist" for their reservation, and the café staff will have these games ready at their table when they arrive.\
The customer receives a confirmation with their reservation details and selected games.

## Exercise 3: Meal Prep Service Customization

The meal prep service customer logs into their account each week to review the upcoming menu.\
The system displays the planned meals with full ingredient lists and nutritional information.\
There are also alternative meals available, if the customer doesn't want to eat the planned meals.\
Based on the customer's dietary profile (vegetarian, allergic to nuts, low-carb, etc.), they can swap out ingredients they can't or don't want to eat.\
For example, if a recipe includes chicken, they might swap it for tofu or chickpeas.\
Once all customizations are confirmed, the personalized meal plan is sent to the kitchen for preparation, and the customer receives updated recipes and reheating instructions for their customized meals.

## Exercise 4: Dog Walker Scheduling and Tracking

The dog walker uses the system to plan their daily schedule of client dogs.\

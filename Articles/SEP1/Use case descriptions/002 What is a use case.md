# What is a use case?

We can say a "use case" is a detailed description of some functionality in the system, that the actor can perform. That sounds like user stories, but it is more than that.\
A single use case can include multiple user stories, and also contains descriptions, and diagrams.

A use case is a collection of detailed descriptions of related success and failure _scenarios_ that describe an actor using a system to support a goal.\
We must describe a piece of functionality in the system, both in terms of how to perform it correctly, but also what happens when something goes wrong. We call these success and failure scenarios.

In the end, we have a very detailed description of a piece of functionality in the system, that the actor can perform.

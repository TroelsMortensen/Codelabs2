# Introduction to Use Case Descriptions

This learning path will introduce you to _use case descriptions_, and how to create them.

They actually come in three forms:

- Brief
- Casual
- Fully dressed

The two former requires little explanation, but the fully dressed one requires a bit of explanation. That's the focus.

In another learning path, I already defined what a use case is. Here I focus on how to describe them.

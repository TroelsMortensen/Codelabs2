# Alternatives to use cases?

In most systems, where users are involved, use cases are a great way to describe the system. However, there are situations where they may not be the best fit.

- Some systems are very technical, and with little human interaction. Like a database system, or other servers.
- Some systems are editing tools, with very tiny features. Consider Word. Would you make a use case for "Add a heading", or "Make text bold", "Make text italic", "Add numbers to section headers", etc.? Perhaps not. In this case, a list of features may be more appropriate.
- Games. In games you can often do so many different things, and sometimes mix them. "The character can jump", "The character can attack", "The character can use a spell", "The character can use a item", etc. There are many behavioural rules in a game. Here, some other approach may be more appropriate.

User stories and use case descriptions are both tools in your ever-growing toolbox. Use the right tool for the job. For many of the systems you will work on during your education, and probably after, use cases will be a good fit.

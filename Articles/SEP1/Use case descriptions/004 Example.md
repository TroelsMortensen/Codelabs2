# Example
Next, let's take a look at an example of a use case description.

First, I will just briefly introduce the domain, and the use case.

Then on the next two pages, I will present three different formats of the use case description. It is the same information, just presented in different ways.

The domain we are looking at is a vehicle rental system. And the particular use case we are looking at is the "Rent a Vehicle" use case.

So, the ***casual*** use case description is as follows:

> A customer contacts the rental company to rent a vehicle. The employer finds the customer in the system, then searches for relevant vehicles. If a matching vehicle is found, the employer reserves the vehicle for the customer, with start and end dates.

In the description I reference both use cases and user stories, to say which user stories are covered by this use case, and which use cases are somehow related to this use case.

User stories have an id prefixed with "US-", and use cases have an id prefixed with "UC-". You can see this in action in the "user stories" and "includes" sections.

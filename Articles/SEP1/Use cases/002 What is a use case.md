# What is a use case?

First, let's define what a scenario is.

We can say a "use case" is a detailed description of some functionality in the system, that the actor can perform. That sounds like user stories, but it is more than that.\
A single use case can include multiple user stories, and comes with a thorough description of the functionality.


## What is a scenario?

A scenario is a specific sequence of actions and interactions between actors and the system. It is one particular story of using a system, or one path through the use case; for example, the scenario of successfully purchasing items with cash, or the scenario of failing to purchase items because of a credit payment denial. Two sides of the same feature.

A use case is a collection of detailed descriptions of related success and failure _scenarios_ that describe an actor using a system to support a goal.\
We must describe a piece of functionality in the system, both in terms of how to perform it correctly, but also what happens when something goes wrong. We call these success and failure scenarios.

## The definition

Informally then, a use case is a collection of related success and failure _scenarios_ that describe an actor using a system to support a goal.

And then, 

> A set of scenarios, where each scenario is a sequence of actions a system performs that yields an observable result of value to a particular actor 

In the end, we have a very detailed description of a piece of functionality in the system, that the actor can perform.

# What is a use case?

First, let's define what a scenario is.

A scenario is a specific sequence of actions and interactions between actors and the system; it is also called a _use case instance_. It is one particular story of using a system, or one path through the use case; for example, the scenario of successfully purchasing items with cash, or the scenario of failing to purchase items because of a credit payment denial. Two sides of the same feature.

Informally then, a use case is a collection of related success and failure _scenarios_ that describe an actor using a system to support a goal.

So, 

> A set of scenarios, where each scenario is a sequence of actions a system performs that yields an observable result of value to a particular actor

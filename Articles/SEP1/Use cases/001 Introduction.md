# What is a use case?

You have already read about user stories (otherwise, do that first). They are a way to describe a feature of the system, from the perspective of the actor. And they are short, and slim on details.

A use case is a more detailed description of a feature of the system. It is a goal, that the actor wants to achieve, and the steps to achieve it.

Use cases are requirements, primarily functional or behavioral requirements that indicate what the system will do. Often, you will stick to one or the other format. We are going to use the use cases to elaborate details on user stories. To deepen our understanding of the system, how to interact with it, what it should do.

Let's start with the short version:

> A use case is a _single goal_ the user wants to achieve

That's about it.

- The user wants to mark an order as shipped
- The user wants to add a new product to the catalog
- The user wants to add a new deep mining record to the catalog
- The user wants to update an existing alien encounter record
- The user wants to move the explorer to a different planet

Each is a single goal, that the user wants to achieve. The user goes over to the computer, opens the application, and performs the action to achieve the goal, and can then close everything down again.

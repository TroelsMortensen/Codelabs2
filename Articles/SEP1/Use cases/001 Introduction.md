# What is a use case?

You have already read about user stories (otherwise, do that first). They are a way to describe a feature of the system, from the perspective of the actor. And they are short, and slim on details.

A use case is a more detailed description of a feature of the system. It is a goal, that the actor wants to achieve, and the steps to achieve it.

Use cases are requirements, primarily functional or behavioral requirements that indicate what the system will do. Often, you will stick to one or the other format. We are going to use the use cases to elaborate details on user stories. To deepen our understanding of the system, how to interact with it, what it should do.

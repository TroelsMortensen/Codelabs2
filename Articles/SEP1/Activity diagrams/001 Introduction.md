# Introducing activity diagrams

An activity diagram is a type of diagram that shows the flow of activities in a system. We can use it to show different things, but we will focus on using it for further elaborating on use cases, how they work.

UML has a standard for activity diagrams, which I will introduce in this learning path.


## For what purpose?

If you have a use case description with a main scenario, and many alternative scenarios, you can use an activity diagram to show the flow of the use case.

The diagram can sometimes provide a better overview of the use case, than the use case description alone. Many branches in a description can get confusing to read. 

Or sometimes, it is simply easier to start with the activity diagram, because it can provide a better overview of the use case.

You can also use it to document the flow of code, an algorithm, or some other behavior. It is a versatile tool, and can be used in many different ways.

## Building blocks

The activity diagram consists of a couple of "building blocks", which we put together to form the diagram.

I will cover:

1) Start
2) The activity
2) Sequence
3) Single selection (if)
4) Double selection (if-else)
5) Multiple selection (switch)
6) Loops
7) End
8) Swimlanes

These building blocks are then connected with arrows to show the flow, or sequence of activities.

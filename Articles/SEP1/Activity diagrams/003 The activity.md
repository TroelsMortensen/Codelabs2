# The activity itself

Any activity (single step, or action) is in a box, with the (short!) description of the activity inside.

Here is an activity, which shows that the user does something.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Do something]
    
    style A fill:#ffffe0,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px,color:#000000,rx:10,ry:10
```

Here is an activity, which shows that the user navigates to a search vehicle view.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Navigate to search vehicle view]
    
    style A fill:#ffffe0,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px,color:#000000,rx:10,ry:10
```


So, an activity is a box with a description inside.

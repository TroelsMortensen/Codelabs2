# Structure

> Please be diligent in structuring the activity diagrams. It is easy to make a mess of it, and it will be difficult to read and understand.

Yes, I have dedicated a page to this, because it is important. Too often do I receive an entangled mess of a diagram, which is difficult to read and understand.

Mostly you should use angled lines to connect the nodes.

Try to align things, so lines have as few bends as possible. And lines are either horizontal or vertical, but not sort of skew/oblique/diagonal/slanted.

Minimize crossing lines.

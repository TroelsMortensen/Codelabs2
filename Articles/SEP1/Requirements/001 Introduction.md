# Introduction

Requirements are the foundation of any software project. They are the what the _system must be able to do_. They are the basis for the design of the system. They are the basis for the implementation of the system. They are the basis for the testing of the system.

And so, they are also a very good starting point, when we start a new project. The basis is often a good starting point.
Once you have the actors in place, you can start to think about _what the actors need from the system_.

Requirements come in many forms, there are many different structures or ways to express the requirements.\
There are also different _types_ of requirements. 

We will look at two categories of requirements:

- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements

And for the functional requirements, we will write them in the form of "user stories".

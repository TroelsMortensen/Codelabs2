# Introduction

Requirements are the foundation of any software project. They are the what the system must be able to do. They are the basis for the design of the system. They are the basis for the implementation of the system. They are the basis for the testing of the system.

And so, they are also a very good starting point, when we start a new project.
Once you have the actors in place, you can start to think about what the actors need from the system.

Requirements come in many forms, there are many different structures or ways to express the requirements.\
There are also different _types_ of requirements. 

We will look at
- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements

And for the functional requirements, we will write them in the form of "user stories".

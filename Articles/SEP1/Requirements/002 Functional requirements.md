# Functional requirements

A functional requirement desribes a specific piece of functionality that the system must be able to do. It is a statement of what the system must be able to do.

For example, a functional requirement for a library system might be:

- The system must be able to add a new book to the library.
- The system must be able to search for a book by title.
- The system must be able to search for a book by author.
- The system must be able to search for a book by ISBN.
- The system must be able to mark a book as loaned out.
- The system must be able to mark a book as returned.

And so on.

Each of these requirements is some action that the user can make through the system.

We focus on the behaviour of the system.

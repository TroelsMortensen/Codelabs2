# Functional requirements

A functional requirement desribes a specific piece of functionality that the system must be able to do. It is a statement of what the system must be able to do.

> The following is an example of what we _will not do_. In semester projects, you will use user stories to express the functional requirements.

For example, a functional requirement for a library system might be:

- The system must be able to add a new book to the library.
- The system must be able to search for a book by title.
- The system must be able to search for a book by author.
- The system must be able to search for a book by ISBN.
- The system must be able to mark a book as loaned out.
- The system must be able to mark a book as returned.

And so on.

Each of these requirements is some action that the user can make through the system.

We focus on the behaviour of the system.

## Limitations

The above way of expressing functional requirements may work, but is lacking in detail. It is not clear _who_ is able to do what. Nor is it clear _why_ they are doing it. We want to improve upon this with user stories.

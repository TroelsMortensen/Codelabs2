# User stories

Requirements can take many forms. One of the more common forms is the _user story_. A user story is a short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the user of the system, with a focus on the business value of the feature.

We have a commonly used template for user stories:

> As a [role], I want to [ability] so that [value].

This is what most projects do.

The alternative, is to put more focus on the business value of the feature. That business value is actually the reason for including the feature in the system, in the first place, so maybe it makes sense to focus on that instead.\
If you choose this approach, you can use the template:

> In order to [value], as a [role], I want to [ability].

Whatever format you choose, at least stick to the same format for all user stories. You will notice that the two templates are actually very similar.

## The business value

Sometimes it can actually be somewhat difficult to identify the business value of a feature. Or it can be difficult to express the business value in a way that is easy to understand.

However, it _is_ the most important part, and thorough thought should be put into it.

# Example user stories

- As a _librarian_, I want to be able to _add a new book to the library_, so that I can _be able to loan out books_.
- As a _librarian_, I want to be able to _search for a book by title_, so that I can _find a book quickly_.
- As a _librarian_, I want to be able to _search for a book by author_, so that I can _find a book quickly_.
- As a _librarian_, I want to be able to _search for a book by ISBN_, so that I can _find a book quickly_.
- As a _librarian_, I want to be able to _mark a book as loaned out_, so that I can _keep track of unavailable books_.
- As a _librarian_, I want to be able to _mark a book as returned_, so that I can _keep track of available books_.

And so on.

And, the above user stories could also be written as:
- In order to _be able to loan out books_, as a _librarian_, I want to be able to _add a new book to the library_.
- In order to _find a book quickly_, as a _librarian_, I want to be able to _search for a book by title_.
- In order to _find a book quickly_, as a _librarian_, I want to be able to _search for a book by author_.
- In order to _find a book quickly_, as a _librarian_, I want to be able to _search for a book by ISBN_.
- In order to _keep track of unavailable books_, as a _librarian_, I want to be able to _mark a book as loaned out_.
- In order to _keep track of available books_, as a _librarian_, I want to be able to _mark a book as returned_.

# User stories

Requirements can take many forms. One of the more common forms is the _user story_. A user story is a short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the user of the system, with a focus on the business value of the feature.

We have a commonly used template for user stories:

> As a [role], I want to [ability] so that [value].

This is what most projects do. There are alternative formats, but this is the most common.

## The business value

Sometimes it can actually be somewhat difficult to identify the business value of a feature. Or it can be difficult to express the business value in a way that is easy to understand.

However, it _is_ the most important part, and thorough thought should be put into it.

## Example user stories

- As a _librarian_, I want to be able to _add a new book to the library_, so that I can _be able to loan out books_.
- As a _librarian_, I want to be able to _search for a book by title_, so that I can _find a book quickly_.
- As a _librarian_, I want to be able to _search for a book by author_, so that I can _find a book quickly_.
- As a _librarian_, I want to be able to _search for a book by ISBN_, so that I can _find a book quickly_.
- As a _librarian_, I want to be able to _mark a book as loaned out_, so that I can _keep track of unavailable books_.
- As a _librarian_, I want to be able to _mark a book as returned_, so that I can _keep track of available books_.

And so on.

## Ordering

There are several ways to order user stories, you should pick one (or maybe some can be combined).

1) **By importance**: The most important user stories first.
2) **By actor**: Group the user stories by actor. Secondarily, you can then order by importance.


Notice, that if you re-order the user stories, the numbers (IDs) should not change!

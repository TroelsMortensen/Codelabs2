# Interview to requirements

In your first semester project, you will be given a case, usually an interview with the _stakeholder_. By random chance, that stakeholder's name is often Bob.

From this interview, you must then extract the requirements for the system. The interview may not alwasy be crystal clear on what is needed, and so you will have to infer the requirements from the interview, as best you can.

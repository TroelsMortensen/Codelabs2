# Non-functional requirements

A nun-functional requirement describes a characteristic of the system that is not related to the functionality of the system. It is a statement of how the system should behave, or how it should be designed.

You can consider it a constraint on the system. It is not specific to a single functional requirement, but to the system as a whole.

When you are finished with implementing the functional requirements, you should be able to go through the non-functional requirements, and see if the system meets them.

## Examples of non-functional requirements

For example, these are the non-functional requirements for your first semester project:

- The system must be developed using Java.
- The system must use the JavaFX library for UI.
- The system must persist data in a file.

Later semester projects will have more non-functional requirements, like adding a database, or adding a web interface.

## How to tell if a requirement is functional or non-functional?

Generally, if the requirement is about the system as a whole, it is a non-functional requirement. If the requirement is about a specific piece of functionality, performed by a user of the system,it is a functional requirement.

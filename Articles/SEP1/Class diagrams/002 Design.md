# The Design process

The design phase is the process of creating a design for a system. It is a process of creating a plan for the system, and how it will be implemented.

This is about creating the blueprint and planning out the system you will build.

From the analysis phase, you have the "what". Okay, so a user must be able to log in, this will require a login screen, that's the how.\
The user must be able to view _X_, this will require a view to display _X_. The data to show _X_ is stored in a file, so we need a class to read the data from the file, and a class to display the data in the view.

So, the design is thinking out these solutions to the "what" part.

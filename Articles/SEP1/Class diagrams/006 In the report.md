# In the report

_Usually_ you have a "Design" chapter in your project report. This would be a good place to include your class diagram.

And here you have to make a choice. 

Often these diagrams become large, and you may want to include them in the report as a separate appendix.


## Full diagram

Personally, I like to see them in the report. In this case, you have to make sure they are in .svg, otherwise the diagrams may become blurry and unreadable. When using .svg, _and exporting to pdf *correctly*_, the diagrams will be sharp and readable, and I can zoom in all I want.

## Low detail diagram

Often a low detailed diagram can make sense. In this case, you do not show methods or attributes. Just the classes and their relationships. This can provide a good quick overview of the system.

Astah has a tool to hide stuff, so you don't have to delete things. But, you may need to re-arrange the diagram because it now requires less space.

## Diagram snippets

Sometimes, it can make sense to show only a part of the diagram, and talk about that. Then, after, you can show another part of the diagram, and talk about that.\
This, however, needs to be done _carefully_, because it can easily become fragmented and confusing for the reader.\
So, before doing this, you should at least provide _some_ kind of overview of the system.

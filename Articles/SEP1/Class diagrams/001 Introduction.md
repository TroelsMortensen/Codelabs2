# Introduction to class diagrams

This article introduces the concept of class diagrams. You have already been drip-wise introduced to class diagrams, throughout the PRO1 course.

The class diagram is a _design artefact_, a way to represent the structure of a system. It is a visual representation of the classes, their attributes, and their relationships. 

> It is a design of your solution

You have been through various analysis artefacts, which were used to understand the problem domain, elaborate on that understanding, and what the system should do, the behaviour, and to create a domain model.
So, analysis is more about the "what". While design is more about the "how".


The class diagram is a _static_ representation of the system. It does not show change in the system over time. It is a snapshot of the system at a given point in time.

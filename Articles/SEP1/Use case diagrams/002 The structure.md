# The structure of the use case diagram

The use case diagram has a specific structure, or layout.

1) Primary actors are on the left. These are the actors which interacts with the system.
2) Use cases are in the middle. These are the actions that the actors can perform. They are encased in a box, representing the system. The bubbles are (for now) the user stories.
3) Supporting actors are on the right. These are the actors which the system uses. They are rare.
4) A box around the use case bubbles, with the name of the system.

Here is a third example, about an ATM system, with a few extra notes:

Notice the "Banking System" supporting actor on the right. That's because the ATM system uses the banking system to get the account information.

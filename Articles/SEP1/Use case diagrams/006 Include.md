## Include relationship

One use case can **include** another use case. In this case, if we have use case A and use case B, in order to execute use case A, use case B must be executed first.

Consider the following example:

![Include example](Resources/Include.png)

This means that if the user wants to "delete a reservation", they **_must_** first find it. You **_cannot_** delete a reservation, without first finding it.

# Use case relationships

Sometimes use cases are related, or somehow connected. Generally that means two use cases are perfomed on after the other, as a whole. 

We have different kinds of relationships, I will cover two of them here.

The relationships are:
- Include
- Extend

Include is about one use case always requires another use case to be executed first.

Extend is about one use case can sometimes proceed into another use case.

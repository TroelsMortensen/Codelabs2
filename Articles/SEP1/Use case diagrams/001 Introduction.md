# Introducing use case diagrams


## What is a use case?

We can say a "use case" is a detailed description of a functionality in the system, that the actor can perform. A single use case can contain multiple user stories, and several diagrams.

These use cases can then be represented in a use case diagram, with the purpose of providing a high-level overview of the system.

Other learning paths will explain the other elements of use cases, e.g. the description, activity diagram, system sequence diagram, etc. All of these can be considered parts of a use case.

We will start with the use case diagram, in the learning path.

## Then, what is the use case diagram?

The _use case diagram_ is an analysis artefact, a UML diagram, that provides an overview of actors in the system, and the actions they can perform.

It is a visual representation of the requirements, with less details. The purpose is to provide a high-level overview of what each user type does in the system.

This "high-level" is achieved by grouping related user stories together into _use cases_. These are represented by bubbles in the diagram. We will explain them in detail on upcoming pages.

The diagram should be accompanied by a table showing which user stories are included in which use cases. This is to make sure every user story is covered.

Consider the following examples:

Here is one for a library system.

# Introducing use case diagrams

The _use case diagram_ is an analysis artefact, a UML diagram, that provides an overview of actors in the system, and the actions they can perform.

It is a visual representation of the requirements, with less details. The purpose is to provide a high-level overview of what each user type does in the system.\
This high-level is achieved by grouping related user stories together into _use cases_.

It should be accompanied by a table showing which user stories are included in which use cases. This is to make sure every user story is covered.

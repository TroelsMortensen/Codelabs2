# Introducing use case diagrams


This learning path will introduce you to use case diagrams, and how to create them.

## What is the use case diagram?

The _use case diagram_ is an analysis artefact, a UML diagram, that provides an overview of actors in the system, and the actions they can perform, i.e. the use cases.

It is a visual representation of the use cases, with less details. The purpose is to provide a high-level overview of what each user type does in the system.

This "high-level" is achieved by just providing titles, or the brief format in a special diagram. 

The diagram should be accompanied by a table showing which user stories are included in which use cases. This is to make sure every user story is covered.

Consider the below examples.

Here is one for a library system.

It should be clear that a `Student` can borrow a book, return a book, etc. While the `Librarian` can manage student accounts, add new books to the library, etc.

And here is a small one for a car rental system.

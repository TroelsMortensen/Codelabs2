# Introduction to JavaFX

JavaFX is a library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Java. It is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building desktop applications.

It's the most modern of the Java GUI libraries, so that's what we will use for PRO1. It's not perfect, but it still uses some modern concepts, which you will encounter in other languages as well as later in your career.

You will probably notice some similarities to e.g. html, css, and javascript.

# Exercise - Contact book 2

This is a continuation of the previous exercise. You will now add the ability to overwrite a contact.

## Add ID to contact

Each contact created should get a unique ID, an integer. The ID should be automatically generated by the ContactManager.\
Use a static field to keep track of the next available ID.

## Show ID

Update the showing of contacts to also include the ID. Format could be something like: \
`1. John Doe - 555-1234`\
`2. Jane Smith - 555-5678`

## Delete contact

Add a third column to the view. This column should contain
- A TextField to input the ID of the contact to delete.
- A Button to delete the contact.
- A Label to display the result of the deletion (if an ID is not found, display an error message)

## Edit contact

Add a fourth column to the view. This column should contain
- A TextField to input the ID of the contact to edit.
- A TextField to input the new name of the contact.
- A TextField to input the new phone number of the contact.
- A Button to update the contact. When clicking the button, remove the existing contact, and add a new contact with the new values.
- A Label to display the result of the updating (if an ID is not found, display an error message, or if the new values are invalid)

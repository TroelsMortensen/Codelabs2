# What is a loop?

A loop is a programming construct that allows you to repeat a block of code multiple times. This is useful when you want to perform the same operation on different data or when you want to execute a block of code until a certain condition is met.

In Java (and most other programming languages), there are several types of loops, including:
- **`for` loop**: Used when you know in advance how many times you want to repeat a block of code. "I want to repeat this _x_ times."
- **`while` loop**: Used when you want to repeat a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. "I want to repeat this until _y_ is true."
- **`do-while` loop**: Similar to the `while` loop, but it guarantees that the block of code will be executed at least once. "I want to repeat this until _y_ is true, but I want to execute the code at least once."
- **`for-each` loop**: Used to iterate over elements in a collection or array. "I want to repeat this for each element in this collection."

In this article, I will cover the first three loop types. I will get back to the for-each loop later in the course when we cover collections and arrays.

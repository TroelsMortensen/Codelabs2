# Exercise - print numbers

## Exercise 1: Print numbers from 0 to 9
Write a Java program that uses a `for` loop to print numbers from 0 to 9. Each number should be printed on a new line.

### Example Output:

```yaml
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
```

<hint title="Solution">

Use a `for` loop with the following structure:
```java
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}

```
</hint>

## Exercise 2: Print numbers from 0 to 99
Write a Java program that uses a `for` loop to print numbers from 0 to 99. Each number should be printed on a new line.

### Example Output:

```yaml
0
1
2
...
98
99
```

<hint title="Solution">

Use a `for` loop with the following structure:
```java
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

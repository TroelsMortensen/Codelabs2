# Types in Java

The type system in Java is divided into two main categories: primitive types and reference types.

You saw primitive types in the previous session, such as `int`, `double`, and `boolean`. These types just hold a single value.

The reference types are more complex. The String is a reference type. Generally we call reference types "objects".\
An object can hold multiple values and has methods that operate on those values. We will dig into objects later in the course. 

For now, just know we operate with two categories of types: primitive and reference.

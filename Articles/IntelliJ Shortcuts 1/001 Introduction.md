# Introduction to IntelliJ Shortcuts

If you watned to, you could write Java in a basic text editor like Notepad. However, using a specialized Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA makes coding much easier and more efficient. IntelliJ provides many features that help you write, debug, and manage your code effectively.

Some of these features are shortcuts, to faster write code, and to get information about the code you are writing. These shortcuts can save you a lot of time and effort, especially as you become more familiar with them.

In this article, I will introduce 4 features.

1) **Code Completion**: IntelliJ can automatically suggest code as you type, which helps you write code faster and with fewer errors.
2) **Quick fix**: If you make a mistake, IntelliJ can suggest ways to fix it quickly.
3) **Method arguments**: When you call a method, IntelliJ shows you the parameters it expects, so you know what to provide.
4) **Method Documentation**: You can view documentation for methods, which helps you understand how to use them without leaving your code.

# Auto Complete
As you write code, IntelliJ IDEA can automatically complete your code based on the _context_. This feature is known as "Code Completion" and can significantly speed up your coding process.

Context is both all the available Java classes and methods, as well as the code you have already written in your current file. IntelliJ uses this context to suggest completions that are relevant to what you are currently typing.

The short cut for this is <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>SPACE</kbd>.

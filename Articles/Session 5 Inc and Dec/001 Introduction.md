# Incrementing and Decrementing

In programming you will often need to increase or decrease a value by one. This is called incrementing or decrementing.

Here is how, you might do this in Java:

```java
int number = 5;
number = number + 1; // Incrementing
number = number - 1; // Decrementing
```

## Incrementing and Decrementing Operators
Java provides special operators for incrementing and decrementing values:

```java
int number = 5;
number++; // Incrementing
number--; // Decrementing
```

These operators are shorthand for adding or subtracting one from a variable. The two above examples do the same thing. The latter is just shorter and easier to read.

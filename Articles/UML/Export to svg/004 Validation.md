Now you have your report as pdf. Great! Wonderful! You made it!

PLEASE, look through your report. Too often I get reports with so blindingly obvious errors, that I have to wonder if the student actually read the report.\


<hint title="Spoiler alert">

They didn't. There is no chance they opened this pdf document, and read it, and _still_ overlooked the errors.

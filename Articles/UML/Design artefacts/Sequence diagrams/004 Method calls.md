# Method calls

The activation bars are only visible when you are adding a method call. In Astah, an activation bar cannot not be added independently.

Therefore, you must have two classes first.


## Adding the arrow
The type of arrow we are looking for is called a "Message". In Astah, this is represented by an S on a little arrow.

You can do mouse over, or you can select the tool from the toolbar.

### Mouse over



### Selecting the tool

So, you select the tool, click the first class, then the second class, and you will see the message arrow.

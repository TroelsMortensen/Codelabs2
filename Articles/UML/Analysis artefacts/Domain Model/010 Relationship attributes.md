# Creating relationship attributes in Domain Models

In Astah, this is called an "association class".

You have two options:
- Use the association class tool from the toolbar.
- Convert an existing relationship to an association class (can be converted back to a normal relationship, _with_ information loss)

## Association class tool

Find this in the toolbar.

The name of the association class become the name of the relationship. I do not like this. I would prefer to name the relationship (on the line), and not have a name on the association class. I am not sure, this is possible in Astah, though.

It is important that the syntax is correct. The line between two entities should be a solid line. The line from the association class to the entities should be a dotted line.
In Astah, this should be straight forward. In other drawing tools, you may need to try to create your own lines, which may not be convenient.

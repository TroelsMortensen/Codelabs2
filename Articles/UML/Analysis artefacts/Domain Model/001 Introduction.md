# Introduction to UML Domain Model

When drawing a Domain Model in UML, it is somewhat similar to a class diagram, but also with some differences, and additional elements. This guide will explain the differences, and how to draw a Domain Model in UML.

I will show this in Astah, but any other diagramming tool can be used. Just follow UML notation.

# Introduction to use case descriptions in Astah

Use case descriptions are easily (and maybe best) done in any text editor. Word, google docs, whatever.

But Astah also offer a way to do it. The benefit is that these descriptions are then connected to your use case diagrams. Maybe this is a relevant benefit.

It uses a fixed table format, so you are locked into this, though you can probably make it work.

Remember to export stuff as .svg.

The draw back here is that if you need to update a description, you cannot do it directly in your report, but must do so in Astah, then export again, and update your report.

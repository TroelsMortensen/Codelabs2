# Introduction to the List

In the previous session, we learned about arrays, which are fixed-size collections of elements. In this session, we will explore the List in Java, which provides a more flexible way to work with collections of objects, or values.

Generally, you will rarely use the array directly, as it is often inconvenient to work with due to its fixed size, and lack of dedicated methods for common operations. Instead, you will typically use the List, or one of the other collection types found in Java.

There are two main types of lists in Java: `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`. Both provide the same behaviour and functionality, but they differ in their underlying implementation and performance characteristics. Those details will be shelved until third semester, however, when you get to the ADS course. This means, for now, it doesn't matter much which of the two versions you choose to use, as they will behave the same way. However, the `ArrayList` is the most commonly used, so all exapmples will use that.

First, we must explore the _concept_ of a List.

Start by watching the video below. It introduces the concept of a list, without discussing programming details. It is important to understand the concept before diving into the code.

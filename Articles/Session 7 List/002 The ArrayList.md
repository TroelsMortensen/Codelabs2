# Introducing the ArrayList

Now that you (hopefully) have some concept of what a List is, and what we can do with it, we should take a look at the Java side of things.

As mentioned, eventually, you will be dealing with three types:
* List
* ArrayList
* LinkedList

The List is the conceptual part, it defines which methods are available on a list type. It is an interface, and we will come back to interfaces later in the course.

We will ignore the LinkedList. You may use it instead of the ArrayList, but all examples going forward will be with the ArrayList.

So, start by watching the video below, to get a brief introduction to how to do some basic operations with the ArrayList in Java. Later, we will explore the ArrayList in more detail, through exercises and examples.

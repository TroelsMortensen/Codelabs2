# The application

This learning path will task you with building a slightly more complex console application. But first, let's define what the application is going to do.


## Background

The application will manage space exploration. Explorers will discover new planets, and may encounter aliens on these planets. We need to document this information, so we can later analyze it.

## Requirements

We divide the requirements into two parts:
- Functional, what the system should do
- Non-functional, how the system should do it

### Functional requirements

- The system should allow users to add new planets (discover them)
- The system should allow users to add new encounters (a physical encounter with an alien)
- The system should allow users to add new aliens (discover a new alien species)
- The system should allow users to add new explorers
- The system should allow users to update the information about a planet
- The system should allow users to update the information about an encounter
- The system should allow users to update the information about an alien
- The system should allow users to update the information about an explorer
- The system should allow users to view all planets
- The system should allow users to view all encounters
- The system should allow users to view all aliens
- The system should allow users to view all explorers
- The system should allow users to view all information about a planet
- The system should allow users to view all information about an encounter
- The system should allow users to view all information about an alien
- The system should allow users to view all information about an explorer


### Non-functional requirements

- The system should persist the data using a binary files.
- The system should be a console application.
- The system should be written in Java.
- The system should be designed using the layered architecture (see previous page).
- The system should be well organized, with a clear separation of concerns.

## Tutorial style

On the next pages, you will be tasked with implementing the application step by step. We will do a layer at a time.

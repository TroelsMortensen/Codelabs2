# List planets

Yeah, you should be familiar with the process by now. Because we are using a _pattern_. Same same over and over.

1) Create the class in the `presentation` package.
2) Add the constructor, which will assign the field variable `dataManager` to a new `FileDataManager` object.
3) Add the handleListPlanets() method, which should print the relevant messages to guide the user through listing the planets.
4) Use the `dataManager` field to get all the planets from storage.
5) Print the planets.
6) Return to the planet management menu.
7) Test.

If the list of planets you get back is empty, just print "No planets found." and return to the planet management menu.

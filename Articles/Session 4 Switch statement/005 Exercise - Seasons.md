# Exercise - Which season is it?

Write a program, which based on the month number (1-12), prints out its corresponding season:

- 1, 2, 3: Winter
- 4, 5, 6: Spring 
- 7, 8, 9: Summer
- 10, 11, 12: Autumn

Either accept input from the console, or just create a helper method and call it with different month numbers from the main method.

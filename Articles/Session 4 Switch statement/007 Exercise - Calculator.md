# Exercise - Calculator

You previously created a simple calculator using if-else statements. Now, let's enhance it by using a switch to handle operations.

Write a program that acts as a simple calculator. The program should:
1. Ask the user to enter two numbers.
2. Ask the user to enter a math operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
3. Perform the operation and print the result.

Use a switch (statement or expression) to generate the result message. 

Example Output:

```yaml
Enter the first number:
10
Enter the second number:
5
Enter the operator (+, -, *, /):
+
The result is: 15
```

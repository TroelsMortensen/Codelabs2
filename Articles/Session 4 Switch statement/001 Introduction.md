# The switch statement

This is another decision structure, similar to the if-statement. Crudely speaking, it does the same as a sequence of if-statements, but it can be more readable and easier to maintain when you have many conditions to check.

There are two types of switch statements in Java: the traditional switch statement and the enhanced switch statement. I will call the latter a switch _expression_.\
They are similar in the an if-else statement is similar to a ternary operator:

- One can execute a block of code based on a condition, 
- while the other can return a value based on a condition.


We will first cover the traditional switch statement.

# Exercise - Animal sounds

Write a program which reads an animal from the console, and prints out its sound. Come up with at least 5 different animals and their sounds. Use a switch to implement this functionality.


Example output:

```yaml
Enter an animal:
dog
The sound of a dog is: Woof!
```

```yaml
Enter an animal:
cat
The sound of a cat is: Meow!
```

## Optional
Redo the exercise, but now with the other type of switch.

2. Ask the user to enter the number of hours that were used.
3. Calculate and display the total charges based on the package and hours used.

### Example Output

Enter the package (A, B, or C):
A
Enter the number of hours used:
15

```


## Exercise - Internet Advertisement

Modify the program you wrote for the Internet Bill exercise so it also calculates and displays:

1. The amount of money Package A customers would save if they purchased Package B.
2. The amount of money Package B customers would save if they purchased Package C.

If there would be no savings, no message should be printed.

### Example Output

```yaml
Enter the package (A, B, or C):
A
Enter the number of hours used:
15
Total charges: $19.95
You would save $5.00 by switching to Package B.
You would save $0.00 by switching to Package C.
```

# Introduction

You have occationally, so far in the course, encountered the word Object. We have Object types, such as `String`, or `ArrayList`, contrary to primitive types like `int`, `char`, etc.

The two categories behave differently, e.g. with regards to their default values, and how they are stored in memory. We have also touched upon this previously.

You have seen that we can call methods on objects, such as `String.length()` or `ArrayList.add()`. But we cannot call methods on primitive types, such as `int.length()` or `char.add()`, because they are not objects. 

You have also heard that Java is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) language, which means that it is built around the concept of objects. Going forward, objects will be a central part of your programming experience in Java. And other OOP languages, such as C#. You will encounter something similar to objects in JavaScript, though the implementation details may differ.

So, it is time to dive deeper into the concept of objects in Java, and how we can create our own objects.

Watch the following video, which introduces the concept of objects in Java:

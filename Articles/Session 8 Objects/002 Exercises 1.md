# Object concept exercises

Let's practice the concepts of objects, by taking some real world objects, and come up with some properties and methods for them.

Now, some of the objects below are quite complex in the real world, so just put down a handful of properties and methods that you think are relevant. 

## Exercise 0: Triangle Object

Write down the properties and methods you might expect a triangle object to have.

For now, keep it in the same format, as you saw in the video:

| TRIANGLE |
|------------------|
**properties**
* ...
* ...

**methods**
* xyz () 
* ...

A bit later, we will look into a more structured way of doing this, called UML.

## Exercise 1: Lamp Object
Write down the properties and methods you would expect a lamp object to have. It is one of those desktop lamps, that you can turn on and off, and adjust the angle of the light.

## Exercise 2: Book Object

Write down the properties and methods you would expect a book object to have. Consider aspects like title, author, number of pages, and methods for reading or flipping pages.

## Exercise 3: Dog Object

Write down the properties and methods you would expect a dog object to have. Consider aspects like breed, age, and methods for barking or fetching.

## Exercise 4: Door Object

Write down the properties and methods you would expect a door object to have. Consider aspects like material, color, and methods for opening or closing.

## Exercise 5: Car Object

Write down the properties and methods you would expect a car object to have. Consider aspects like make, model, year, and methods for starting the engine or honking the horn.

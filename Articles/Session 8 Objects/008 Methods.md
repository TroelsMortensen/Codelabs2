# Introducing methods in Java

You have already seen methods in Java, you have used them in the previous sessions, but you have not formally been introduced to them yet. And while you have _used_ methods, you have perhaps not written that many yourself.

Here are a few examples of methods you have seen:

```java
System.out.println("Hello, World!"); // A method call to print a message
String name = "Alice"; // A variable assignment, which is also a method call
int length = name.length(); // A method call to get the length of a string
String input = scanner.nextLine(); // A method call to read input from the user
```

Methods are blocks of code that perform a specific task. They can take inputs (called parameters) and return outputs (called return values).

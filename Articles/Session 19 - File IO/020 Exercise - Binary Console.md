# Exercise - Binary Console App

Just redo the text-console app, but this time, use binary data instead.

Functionality:

- Allow user to specify the filename (automatically add .bin extension)
- Prompt user for text content
- Put this into an object, some kind of data object, similar to the MyData class in the previous exercise
- Write the object to a binary file
- View all files in the folder
- Allow the user to choose a file to read
- Read the object from the binary file
- Print the object to the console

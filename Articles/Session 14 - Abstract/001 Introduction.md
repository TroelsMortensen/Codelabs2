# Introduction to Abstract Classes

## Building on Inheritance

In the previous session (Session 13 - Inheritance), you learned the fundamentals of inheritance in Java. You discovered how classes can inherit from other classes using the `extends` keyword, how to override methods, and how polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated uniformly.

Now it's time to explore the next level of inheritance: **abstract classes and methods**. These concepts take inheritance to a new level by allowing you to create classes that cannot be instantiated directly but serve as blueprints for other classes.

## What You'll Learn

This session will cover:

1. **Polymorphism Recap** - A quick review of what polymorphism means in Java
2. **Casting Recap** - Understanding `instanceof` and type casting
3. **What is Abstract** - The conceptual foundation of abstract programming
4. **Abstract Classes** - Creating classes that cannot be instantiated
5. **Abstract Methods** - Defining methods that must be implemented by subclasses
6. **Abstract in UML** - How to represent abstract classes in diagrams
7. **The `final` Keyword** - Preventing inheritance and method overriding
8. **Fixing `equals` Method** - Proper implementation in inheritance hierarchies

## Why Abstract Classes Matter

Abstract classes are powerful because they:

- **Force structure** - Ensure subclasses implement required methods
- **Share common code** - Provide implementation that all subclasses can use
- **Define contracts** - Specify what subclasses must do without saying how
- **Enable polymorphism** - Allow different implementations of the same interface

## Real-World Analogy

Think of an abstract class like a **recipe template**. 

- You can't eat the template itself (can't instantiate abstract class)
- It tells you what ingredients you need (abstract methods)
- It provides some common steps (concrete methods)
- Each chef must follow the template but can add their own twist (subclass implementation)

For example, a "Cake Recipe" template might specify:
- You must add flour (abstract method)
- You must add sugar (abstract method)
- You must bake at 350Â°F (concrete method)
- But you can choose chocolate, vanilla, or strawberry (subclass choice)

## What's Next

In the following articles, we'll explore each of these concepts in detail, starting with a quick recap of polymorphism and casting, then diving deep into abstract classes and their powerful applications in Java programming.

Get ready to take your inheritance skills to the next level!

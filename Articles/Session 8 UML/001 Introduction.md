# Introduction

In the Objects learning path, you saw a video about objects, and how we define them by their:
- name (class name)
- data (field variables)
- behaviour (methods)

It looked something like this:

This, however, was an informal, detail-lacking approach, I just made up on the spot.

Instead, we want a standardized approach, so that everyone aggrees on what different notation means, and how to express different elements of programming. The is where UML enters the picture
  
## What is UML

UML stands for **Unified Modeling Language**. It is a standardized graphical language used to visualize, specify, construct, and document the artifacts of a software system.

Think of it as a blueprint.

Just like an architect creates blueprints before building a house, software developers use UML to create a design for a program before they start coding.

Key points about UML:
- It is a **visual language**, using diagrams to represent system components. We use it for planning and documentation of software systems.
- It is **standardized**, meaning the symbols and notations have consistent meanings for everyone.
- It is **not a programming language**, nor is it specific to Java.
- It helps in communicating complex ideas about software design to different stakeholders (developers, project managers, clients).

There are many types of UML diagrams, each for a specific purpose (e.g., Use Case diagrams, Sequence diagrams, State diagrams). In this session, we will focus on one of the most common type: the **Class Diagram**.

Above is a blueprint for a house, below is a blueprint, or, _class diagram_ for a system:

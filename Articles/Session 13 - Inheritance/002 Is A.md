# The "Is A" Relationship

Inheritance represents an **"is a"** relationship between classes. This means that a child class **is a** type of its parent class. This is the most common way to use inheritance.

## Examples of "Is A" Relationships

Let's revisit the examples from the previous page:

### People Example
- A **Student** *is a* **Person**
- A **Teacher** *is a* **Person**
- A **Doctor** *is a* **Person**

### Animal Example
- A **Dog** *is an* **Animal**
- A **Cat** *is an* **Animal**
- A **Bird** *is an* **Animal**

### Vehicle Example
- A **Car** *is a* **Vehicle**
- A **Motorcycle** *is a* **Vehicle**
- A **Truck** *is a* **Vehicle**

## Testing the "Is A" Relationship

To determine if inheritance is appropriate, ask yourself:
> "Is [Child Class] a [Parent Class]?"

If the answer is **yes**, then inheritance may be appropriate.

### Good Examples:
- ✅ Is a Student a Person? **Yes** → Inheritance is good
- ✅ Is a Car a Vehicle? **Yes** → Inheritance is good
- ✅ Is a Dog an Animal? **Yes** → Inheritance is good

### Bad Examples:
- ❌ Is a Person a Student? **No** → Inheritance is wrong
- ❌ Is a Vehicle a Car? **No** → Inheritance is wrong
- ❌ Is a Student a Teacher? **No** → Inheritance is wrong

## Comparison with Other Relationships

You have already seen four other relationships, so let's compare them to each other (ignoring the dependency relationship for now).

### Association (Has A)
- Represents a "has a" or "uses a" relationship
- Example: A **Person** *has a* **Car**
- Example: A **Student** *uses a* **Computer**

### Aggregation (Has A - Part of)
- Represents a "has a" relationship where some objects can be considered part of another object
- Example: A **University** *has* **Students** (students can exist without the university)
- Example: A **Car** *has* **Wheels** (wheels can exist without the car)

### Composition (Has A - Cannot exist without)
- Represents a "has a" relationship where some objects cannot exist without the whole
- Example: A **Heart** *is part of* a **Person** (heart cannot exist without the person)
- Example: A **Room** *is part of* a **House** (room cannot exist without the house)

### Inheritance (Is A)
- Represents an "is a" relationship
- Example: A **Student** *is a* **Person**
- Example: A **Car** *is a* **Vehicle**


## Key Points

1. **Inheritance is about classification**: Child classes are specialized versions of parent classes
2. **All child classes share common characteristics** from their parent
3. **Child classes can add unique features** not present in the parent
4. **The "is a" test is a decent way** to determine if inheritance is appropriate

# Assigning Values to Variables

You assign values to variables using the `=` operator. The variable name comes before the `=`, and the value comes after it. 

For example:

```java
int x = 5; 
double pi = 3.14; 
String name = "Alice";
```

The above code exemplifies three assignments:
- `int x = 5;` assigns the integer value `5` to the variable `x`.
- `double pi = 3.14;` assigns the floating-point value `3.14` to the variable `pi`.
- `String name = "Alice";` assigns the string value `"Alice"` to the variable `name`.

## Statements
A statement is a complete instruction that the Java compiler can execute. In Java, statements end with a semicolon (`;`).

Each of the three assignments above is a statement. You can think of statements as the building blocks of your program, where each statement performs a specific action.\
A statement is a command to the Java compiler to perform a specific task, such as declaring a variable, assigning a value, or calling a method (meaning performing some action, like printing text to the console).

A statement can be as simple as an assignment as a long chain of commands that perform a complex task.

But the statement must always end with a semicolon (`;`).

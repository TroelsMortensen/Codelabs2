# Character

The `char` data type is used to store a single character.\
For example, you can declare a `char` variable like this:

```java
char letter = 'A';
char number = '7';
char symbol = '@';
char unicodeChar = '\u03A9'; // Greek letter Î©
```

Notice that characters are enclosed in single quotes (`'`).

## Exercise - Character Example

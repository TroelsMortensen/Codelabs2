# The End

That is all for now. I hope you have at least add a few extra features. But you will probably also note that each feature is fairly similar to the previous ones, making further implementation somewhat trivial and repetitive, once you have the _pattern_ down.

Later in the course, we will add a GUI, using JavaFX. But the design ideas here are still valid. Your GUI will also consist of multiple classes, and you will need to design them accordingly.

On your second semester, we will base further design improvements on the work presented here. We will expand upon the layered architecture, but the core idea remains the same: separate the concerns of your application.

# Let the computer guess a number

In a previous exercise, you had to write a program, where the computer generated a random number, you had to guess it. We now invert this.

You think of a random number between 1 and 1000. Don't tell the computer.

Now, write a program, where the computer will try to guess your number. For each guess, you must input if the guess is correct, above, or below.

The program should roughly behave as follows:

* Print the guess to the screen.
* If the guess is correct, the user inputs `correct`, and the program prints the total number of guesses to the screen and end the program.
* Otherwise, tell the program if the guess was too `low` or too `high`.
  
Consider how to write the program, so the `low` and `high` inputs are used by the program, to adjust its guesses.

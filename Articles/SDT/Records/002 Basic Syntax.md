# Basic Syntax

Let's see how records compare to traditional classes and learn the basic syntax.

## Comparison: Traditional Class vs Record

Instead of writing a full class:

```java
// Traditional DTO class
public class PlanetDTO 
{
    private final int id;
    private final String name;
    private final String climateDescription;
    
    public PlanetDTO(int id, String name, String climateDescription) 
    {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.climateDescription = climateDescription;
    }
    
    public int getId() { return id; }
    public String getName() { return name; }
    public String getClimateDescription() { return climateDescription; }
    
    // equals, hashCode, toString would need to be implemented...
}
```

You can write a record:

```java
// Record DTO
public record PlanetDTO(
    int id,
    String name,
    String climateDescription
) {}
```

That's it! The record automatically provides everything the class above has.

## Record Syntax

The basic syntax for a record is:

```java
public record RecordName(
    Type1 field1,
    Type2 field2,
    Type3 field3
) {}
```

- The record name follows the same naming conventions as classes
- Fields are declared in the parentheses
- The body `{}` can be empty or contain additional methods
- All fields are automatically `final` and `private`

## Accessor Methods

Records generate accessor methods, but they use a different naming convention than traditional getters. They are just the field name, without the "get" prefix.

```java{10}
public record PlanetDTO(
    int id,
    String name,
    String climateDescription
) {}

// Usage
PlanetDTO planet = new PlanetDTO(1, "Kepler-442b", "Temperate");

String theName = planet.name(); // Note: getter is just name(), not getName()

System.out.println(theName);  
System.out.println(planet.id());    // Accessor methods don't have "get" prefix
```

**Key difference:**
- Traditional classes: `planet.getName()`
- Records: `planet.name()`

The accessor method name matches the field name directly, without the "get" prefix.


## What's Generated Automatically

When you declare a record, Java automatically generates:

1. **Private final fields** for each component
2. **Canonical constructor** that takes all components. 
3. **Accessor methods** (getters) for each component
4. **equals()** method that compares all components
5. **hashCode()** method based on all components
6. **toString()** method that includes all components

> A canonical constructor is the constructor automatically generated by a Java record. It's called "canonical" because it's the standard/default constructor that matches the record's component list.

All of this is generated from your simple record declaration!

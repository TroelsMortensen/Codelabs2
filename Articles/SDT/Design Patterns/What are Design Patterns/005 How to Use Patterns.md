# How to Use Patterns

Understanding what patterns are and their categories is just the beginning. Let's explore how to effectively use patterns in your software development.

## Patterns Are Tools, Not Goals

**Important principle:** Patterns are tools to solve problems, not goals to achieve.

- ❌ **Wrong approach**: "I want to use the Factory pattern in this project"
- ✅ **Right approach**: "I have a problem with object creation. Does the Factory pattern solve it?"

Always start with the problem, not with the pattern.

## The Right Mindset

### Recognize the Problem First

The best way to use patterns:

1. **Encounter a design problem** in your code
2. **Recognize** that it's a recurring type of problem
3. **Research** patterns that might solve it
4. **Understand** how the pattern works
5. **Adapt** the pattern to your specific situation
6. **Evaluate** whether it actually solves your problem

### Don't Force Patterns

Avoid this anti-pattern:

- Starting with a pattern you want to use
- Looking for places to apply it
- Forcing it into your design even when it doesn't fit

This leads to over-engineering and unnecessary complexity.

## Learning Patterns Effectively

When studying a specific pattern:

### 1. Study the Problem It Solves

- What design problem does this pattern address?
- What are the symptoms that indicate you need this pattern?
- What happens if you don't use a pattern for this problem?

### 2. Understand the Solution Structure

- What classes and objects are involved?
- How do they relate to each other?
- What are the key relationships?

### 3. Know When to Apply It

- In what situations is this pattern appropriate?
- What are the prerequisites for using this pattern?
- What problems does it solve well?

### 4. Know When NOT to Apply It

- When is this pattern overkill?
- What are simpler alternatives?
- What are the trade-offs?

A pattern is only useful if you understand both when to use it and when not to use it.

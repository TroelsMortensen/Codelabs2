# How to Apply Principles

Understanding what principles are and why they're valuable is important, but the real skill is knowing how to apply them effectively in practice.

## Principles Are Guidelines, Not Laws

**Important:** Design principles are **guidelines**, not absolute laws that must always be followed.

- They're tools to help you make better decisions
- They're heuristics based on experience
- Context matters - sometimes breaking a principle is the right choice
- The goal is better software, not perfect adherence to principles

## Apply Principles Judiciously

### Not Dogmatically

**Avoid this approach:**
- Following principles blindly without considering context
- Applying principles everywhere, even when they don't help
- Treating principles as rigid rules that can never be violated

**Better approach:**
- Understand what problem a principle addresses
- Apply it when it helps solve that problem
- Recognize when a principle doesn't apply or conflicts with others

### Consider Context

The same principle might be more or less important depending on:

- **Project type** - A prototype might prioritize speed over perfect structure
- **Team size** - Larger teams benefit more from consistency principles
- **Code lifetime** - Code that will be maintained for years needs different principles than throwaway scripts
- **Domain complexity** - Complex domains might need more flexibility principles


## Learning Principles Effectively

When studying a specific principle:

### 1. Understand the Problem It Addresses

- What design problem does this principle solve?
- What are the symptoms that indicate you need this principle?
- What happens if you ignore this principle?

### 2. Know When to Apply It

- In what situations is this principle most valuable?
- What are the prerequisites for applying it?
- When does this principle help the most?

### 3. Know When It Might Conflict

- What other principles might conflict with this one?
- When might following this principle cause problems?
- How do you balance it with other principles?

### 4. Practice Recognition

- Learn to recognize when code violates a principle
- Practice refactoring code to better follow principles
- Evaluate existing code against principles

## Principles Help Evaluate Designs

Principles provide **criteria for evaluation**:

- "Does this design follow good principles?"
- "Where does this code violate principles?"
- "How can we improve this to better follow principles?"

Use principles to:

- **Review code** - Evaluate whether designs are good
- **Refactor code** - Identify what needs improvement
- **Discuss designs** - Communicate about design quality
- **Learn from examples** - Understand why some designs work better

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Treating Principles as Laws

Following principles dogmatically without considering context.

**Solution:** Treat principles as helpful guidelines, not rigid rules.

### Mistake 2: Ignoring Principles

Not using principles at all, making arbitrary design decisions.

**Solution:** Learn principles and use them to guide your decisions.

### Mistake 3: Applying Principles Blindly

Using principles without understanding what problems they solve.

**Solution:** Understand the "why" behind each principle, not just the "what."

### Mistake 4: Not Recognizing Conflicts

Following one principle while violating another, without realizing it.

**Solution:** Learn multiple principles and understand how they relate.

# The State interface

You will need an interface to represent the states of the LiveStock.

Put this in the same package. Consider the access modifier.

The interface will need at least two methods:

- `calculatePriceChange`: this returns a double, representing the change in price.
- `getName`: this returns a string, representing the name of the state.

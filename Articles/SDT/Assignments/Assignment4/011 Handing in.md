# Handing in

As usual, handing in is optional. I do intend to provide feedback if you hand in on time.



If you wish to hand in, you can do so on itslearning.

You will find an assignment on itslearning. Just hand in a link to the stockmarket sub-folder containing your code on GitHub.

Do make sure to upload relevant other documentation, such as the class diagram, and the state machine diagram.

## Assignment 4 deliverables

- LiveStock state machine diagram

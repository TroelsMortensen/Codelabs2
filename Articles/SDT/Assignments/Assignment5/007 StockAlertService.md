# The StockAlertService class

> This is an optional deliverable.

This is also a service class. It is responsible for sending alerts to the user. It also listens to the `StockMarket` for updates, and sends alerts when certain conditions are met.

Example alerts:
- A stock has reached a certain price.
- A stock has reached a certain percentage change.
- A stock as gone bankrupt.
- A stock has reset and is available for purchase again.
- ... whatever else you can come up with.

This means that the StockAlertService can send multiple types of notifications. Potentially.

## Testing

Sure, this is a great idea. Verify your code works.

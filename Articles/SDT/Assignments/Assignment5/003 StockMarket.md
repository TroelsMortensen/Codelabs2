# Update the StockMarket singleton to use the Observer pattern

You have seen at least one way to implement the Observer pattern. You may have seen several others.  
You can pick the approach you prefer.


## To Subject

Make the `StockMarket` class a `Subject`. Pick your approach. You can use the original version, or the newer PropertyChangeSupport version. Or something else.

Decide, after thorough consideration, how the data is represented.

Also consider _what_ data is sent. Still, you may end up changing this later. That's fine.

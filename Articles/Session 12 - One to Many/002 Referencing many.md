## The real world

When we need to model the real world in our software, we do so by creating objects, which represent real-world objects. And these objects are related to each other. We model these relationships in our code, by creating objects that reference other objects.

Your object model of the real world will then become this web of interconnected objects. This is sometimes called a _graph_.

So, we will see how to express this in UML, and then code.

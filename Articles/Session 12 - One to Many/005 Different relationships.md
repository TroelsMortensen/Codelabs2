# Different relationship types

In a previous session, you learned about the different relationship types. You saw how they were defined in UML, and how they were expressed in code, with regards to referencing _one_ object.

We have four types of relationships:
- dependency
- association
- aggregation
- composition

However, the dependency is not interesting today.

Turns out this was a short page... maybe I will expand on this in the future.

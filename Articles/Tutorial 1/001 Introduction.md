# Introduction


**Lines for the version including the code block content:**

1.  `# Main Title`
2.  (blank line)
3.  `Some text. **Bolded**.`
4.  (blank line)
5.  `## List Section`
6.  (blank line)
7.  `- Item A`
8.  `- Item B`
9.  (blank line)
10. `1. Num 1`
11. `2. Num 2`
12. (blank line)
13. `[Link](#)`
14. (blank line)
15. `` `inline_code` ``
16. (blank line)
17. `---`
18. (blank line)
19. ` \`\`\`text` (This line itself isn't rendered but is part of the Markdown source)
20. `Placeholder`
    ... and so on. The ````text` example itself is 5 lines (including the fences).

The second example (`# Title Placeholder`...) is probably closest to what you're looking for in terms of variety within a strict 20-line source.

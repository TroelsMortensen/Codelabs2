You are being introduced to UML (Unified Modeling Language), throughout the course, and so, various parts have popped up at various times throughout the course.\

So, the UML teachings were spread out, over many learning paths.

This article aims to put it all in one place.

I also, eventually, plan on having small videos accompanying each page, explaining how to do that particular concept in Astah.

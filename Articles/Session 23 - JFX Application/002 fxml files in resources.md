# Putting fxml files in resources

It is recommended to put the fxml files in a resources package, to keep them separate from the code. This is common practice.

Watch the video below to see how this is done.

We will aim to use this approach going forward.

[Here is the code from the video](https://github.com/TroelsMortensen/JavaFxExamples/tree/master/14_FxmlFilesInResourceFolder)

## Is this necessary?

For your projects, running the code through IntelliJ, you can keep the fxml files in the same package as the code, as we have done up to now.

The official recommend approach is to keep the fxml files in the resources package. 

It is up to you to decide what approach to take.
